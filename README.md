# mismatched-ssl
Check the validity of a target's SSL certificate

The SSL certificate is a security mechanism that encrypts the information exchanged between the target and the client to protect the privacy and integrity of your information. If the target's SSL certificate is not valid or does not match the connection, "mismatched-ssl" output may be generated. The "ssl" output indicates that the target is using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), a security protocol for Internet communication.
